# Tencent Cloud User Generated Short Video （UGSV） SDK

_[简体中文](README.md) | English_

## SDK Upgrade Description

UGSV SDK mobile version 10.1 is built with the same “Tencent Video“ kernel, and the video playback capability is fully optimized and upgraded.

At the same time, the license verification of the "Video Playback" function module will be added from this version onwards.

- If your app already has a UGSV license, you can continue to use it normally after upgrading to version 10.1. You can check your current license information by logging into the Tencent Cloud Console.

- If you have never obtained the above License before and need to use the on-demand playback function in the new version of SDK (10.1 and later), you need to purchase the specified License to obtain the license in the [console](https://www.tencentcloud.com/account/login?s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.tencentcloud.com%2Ftencent-rtc%3Ffrom_qcintl%3Dclick_products_trtc%26ext1%3DGet_Started_for_Free).

- if you do not need to use the relevant function or have not upgraded to the latest version of SDK, you will not be affected by this change.
